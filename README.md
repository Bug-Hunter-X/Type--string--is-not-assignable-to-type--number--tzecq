This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers and return a number. However, in the example usage, a string is passed as the second argument, causing a type error. The solution shows how to handle this by using type guards or type assertions to ensure the input is of the correct type.
